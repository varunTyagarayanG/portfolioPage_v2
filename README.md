# Advanced System Design for Portfolio with Blog

This project evolves a personal portfolio with a blogging feature into a scalable and robust system, implementing advanced system design principles.

## Planned Implementations

### 1. **Scalability and Availability**
   - Managed by Kubernetes and Docker:
     - Docker containers for application encapsulation.
     - Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability, high availability, and failover.

### 2. **Load Balancer**
   - Distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple server instances managed by Kubernetes.

### 3. **Database Design**
   - Use MongoDB with sharding and replication for scalability and fault tolerance.
   - Index frequently accessed fields for performance optimization.

### 4. **Message Broker**
   - Integrate RabbitMQ or Kafka for a pub-sub architecture.
   - Manage asynchronous events like blog publishing, notifications, and updates.

### 5. **Caching Mechanism**
   - Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed blog and portfolio data.
   - Reduce database load with API response caching.

### 6. **Content Delivery**
   - Use CDNs for serving static assets like images and stylesheets globally.


## Deployment Architecture
   - Frontend: Deployed on Netlify (transitioning to S3 + CloudFront for scalability).
   - Backend: Hosted on Kubernetes clusters with Docker containers behind a load balancer.
   - Monitoring: Use CloudWatch for logging and performance tracking.

## Future Scope
   - Real-time notifications for blog comments and likes.

   - API gateway for enhanced request management and authentication.
   - Enhanced analytics for user engagement insights.
